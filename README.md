RacePlayback is an ambitious F1 replay ecosystem combining:

* Python API server for session data, telemetry, and team radio
* Minestom server for 1:1 scaled Minecraft race replays
* Full caching and timeline syncing for accurate multi-driver replay

This project turns publicly available F1 telemetry and radio feeds into a fully interactive, immersive replay experience inside Minecraft.

## Features

### Telemetry & Race Data

* Get drivers from a session
* Fetch all laps of a session or a specific driver
* Access per-lap telemetry: `Distance`, `Speed`, `Throttle`, `Brake`, `RPM`, `DRS`
* Pit stop info with duration calculated automatically from entry/exit
* Session info: type, length, weather, timestamps
* Race control messages

### Weather

* Timestamps in a session include rain info, perfect for dynamic replay effects

### Events & Season Data

* All race events from a year available for queries

### Team Radio (Whisper-Powered)

* Fully transcribed radio messages for each race
* Messages appear in chat:

```
[TEAM RADIO] (VER) Box box
[TEAM RADIO] (HAM) Watch out for debris
```

* Synced with session timestamps for realistic replay

### Minestom Replay Server

* Entities represent F1 cars at 1:1 scale
* Smooth movement using telemetry
* Multi-driver support with perfectly synced timelines
* Optional gear/RPM/DRS display for extra realism

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kohanmathers/raceplayback.git
cd raceplayback
```

2. Set up Python API

```bash
cd api
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the API

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Set up Minestom server

```bash
cd minestom-server
./gradlew run
```

5. Configure API endpoint in Minestom config to point to your running Python server

## Architecture

```
Python API Server                  Minestom Server
----------------                  ----------------
- Session caching                  - Display entities
- Telemetry fetch & processing     - Timeline playback engine
- Team radio transcription          - Movement interpolation
- Pit stop & race control          - Multi-driver sync
- Event & weather info
- DB cache for all sessions
```

* Caching: Redis-free, all session data stored in a DB for fast repeated access
* Team radios: Downloaded as MP3 → transcribed via Whisper → added to JSON → temp file deleted

---

## Notes

* Only race sessions are fully supported for team radio
* Older sessions (pre-2018) may have limited telemetry

---

## Roadmap

* Multi-series support beyond F1 (NASCAR, IndyCar, etc.)
* Optional radio audio playback inside Minecraft
* Improved interpolation for smoother cornering
* Live session support for real-time telemetry sync

## Contributing

PRs welcome, but know this repo is messy, ambitious, and a little chaotic. If you understand FastF1, Minestom, and Whisper, you’re in the club.
